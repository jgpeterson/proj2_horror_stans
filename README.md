For my second project in WDI12, I created an app that allows die hard horror fans to find upcoming horror events/screenings/festivals near them by entering in their zip code at the home screen. Once users enter my site by entering in their zip code, they are given many events to choose from along with user reviews and blogs about horror. After selecting on a venue/theater, they are taken to the page that lists the upcoming events as well as directions to that particular venue. Admin features also include being able to add a theater/venue as well as events.


Technologies used:

HTML5
CSS
JavaScript
jQuery
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB.js
Heroku (used to deploy the finalized working app)


FEATURES:
Audio music for site
Search bar
Social Media share options

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:

I would love to master CSS a bit more on the next project as well as adding other cool site features. But all in all, Ill say that I feel far far better at the end of this project than I did at the end of project 1. Having the annotations and stuff that Danny wrote in while working and building really really helped me understand how routes work and what they do. I feel ready for Project 3.
